EmmetBlue is an enterprise-strength software for the Healthcare Industry. It does three things:

1. Modularizes features and enables the development of modular interfaces that are scaffolded within a runner that manages the 'emmetblue ecosystem'
2. Provides a cloud-native development, testing and depolyment model that works across hybrid, host - cloud and host - host environments, stealthily and resiliently. 
3. Resiliently distributes, streams and consumes data across different sources, formats and locations in realtime.
